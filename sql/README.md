# SQL

## introduction

In this project different sql queries were use in order to ouput the ata ruquired different types of SQL commands were used such as GROUP BY , WHERE,HAVING. Many type od sql operation ere perfomed such as agrregations and joins. In some of the sql queries some other script could have also returned the desired output by the parctice but in each of the script the most simple query was selected since it is agood pratcice to always use the simplest query with less commands. 

## Scripts
This script insterts a new record in the facilities table
```
insert into cd.facilities
    (facid, name, membercost, guestcost, initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance)
    values (9, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800);

```
This script inserts a new record and automatically generates the value for the facid
```
insert into cd.facilities
    (facid, name, membercost, guestcost, initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance)
    select (select max(facid) from cd.facilities)+1, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800;  
```

This sctript modifies the  the outlay in the facilities table
```

update cd.facilities
    set initialoutlay = 10000
    where facid = 1;
```
This script updates the cost in the facilities table
```
update cd.facilities facs
    set
        membercost = (select membercost * 1.1 from cd.facilities where facid = 0),
        guestcost = (select guestcost * 1.1 from cd.facilities where facid = 0)
    where facs.facid = 1;  
```

 This script deletes the data from the bookings table      
```
truncate cd.bookings;
```
This script deletes records from the members table that has an specific characteristic
```
delete from cd.members where memid = 37;

This script produces the list of member and the member who recommended them with no joins and ordered by surname,firstname
```
select distinct mems.firstname || ' ' ||  mems.surname as member,
	(select recs.firstname || ' ' || recs.surname as recommender 
		from cd.members recs 
		where recs.memid = mems.recommendedby
	)
	from 
		cd.members mems
order by member;
```

This script displays a list of how many members each member has recommended  order by id
```
select recommendedby, count(*) 
	from cd.members
	where recommendedby is not null
	group by recommendedby
order by recommended
```
This script produces a list of total slots booked in all facilities ordered by facilities id
```
select facid, sum(slots) as "Total Slots"
	from cd.bookings
	group by facid
order by facid;      
```

This script produces a list of the total slots booked by facility in a pecific time frame order by number od slots

```

## Tables Setup
All tables where constructed specifying their field and primary keys ad well ad forign keys in order to identify the relatiomship between the tables. In ther vitual machine we loaded sample data.

## Tables

cd.members

```
CREATE TABLE cd.members
    (
       memid integer NOT NULL, 
       surname character varying(200) NOT NULL, 
       firstname character varying(200) NOT NULL, 
       address character varying(300) NOT NULL, 
       zipcode integer NOT NULL, 
       telephone character varying(20) NOT NULL, 
       recommendedby integer,
       joindate timestamp NOT NULL,
       CONSTRAINT members_pk PRIMARY KEY (memid),
       CONSTRAINT fk_members_recommendedby FOREIGN KEY (recommendedby)
            REFERENCES cd.members(memid) ON DELETE SET NULL
    );

```

cd.facilities
```
  CREATE TABLE cd.facilities
    (
       facid integer NOT NULL, 
       name character varying(100) NOT NULL, 
       membercost numeric NOT NULL, 
       guestcost numeric NOT NULL, 
       initialoutlay numeric NOT NULL, 
       monthlymaintenance numeric NOT NULL, 
       CONSTRAINT facilities_pk PRIMARY KEY (facid)
    );
```
cd.bookings

```
 CREATE TABLE cd.bookings
    (
       bookid integer NOT NULL, 
       facid integer NOT NULL, 
       memid integer NOT NULL, 
       starttime timestamp NOT NULL,
       slots integer NOT NULL,
       CONSTRAINT bookings_pk PRIMARY KEY (bookid),
       CONSTRAINT fk_bookings_facid FOREIGN KEY (facid) REFERENCES cd.facilities(facid),
       CONSTRAINT fk_bookings_memid FOREIGN KEY (memid) REFERENCES cd.members(memid)
    );
          ```

## Testing
All tests  were poduced with the sampe data on the virtual machine. All test were passed for each of the queries run agians all difeferent constructed tables.
